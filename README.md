# CybervetsInfo
a new repository for cybervets cohort 6
Hello everyone, My name is Chase Baumfalk and am currently in the Cybervets program. In this program we are developing our skills as entry-level cybersecurity interns.
I joined the Airforce 6 years ago as an aircraft hydraulics specialist, working on the C130j and maintaining its emergency and normal flight systems, as well as the landing gear components. I have always been interested in computers and decided to begin my degree in Information technology with the university of phoenix.
I learned about the skillbridge opportunity and started to reasearch that more than a year ago. I finally found this Cybervets program and pursued it as it seems like the best program out there. 
This eportfolio will blossom into a site where I can show all my credentials as well as future projects.
